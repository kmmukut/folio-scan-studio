# Folio architecture

Folio's purpose: **replace obsolete software, not functioning hardware.** A
small Linux computer should be enough to give an older USB or network
printer/scanner a modern, private, network-wide experience.

## The three layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Implemented by |
|---|---|---|
| **Device** | Talk to hardware over USB, IPP, JetDirect, LPD, eSCL, WSD… | CUPS, SANE (incl. `sane-airscan`), Avahi — standard Linux services |
| **Sharing** | Let any phone or computer print and scan *without Folio's UI*: driverless printing (AirPrint / IPP Everywhere / Mopria) and network scanning (eSCL / saned) | The same services, configured by Folio |
| **Workflow** | Scan workbench, non-destructive editing, document library, Print Desk, accounts, diagnostics | Folio's web app (this repository) |

Most of what makes an old printer feel modern comes from the sharing layer.
Folio's job is to make the device and sharing layers easy to set up and keep
healthy, and to make the workflow layer excellent.

## Current structure (0.9.6)

- `backend/app.py`: FastAPI routes, auth middleware, scan and print flows.
- `backend/devices.py`: scanner registry (`data/devices.json`), generated
  `sane-airscan` config, read-only CUPS discovery and capability parsing,
  short-lived device-query cache with CUPS backoff.
- `backend/printing.py`: print-file validation, page selection, scaling,
  colour conversion, media/tray naming.
- `backend/processing.py`: non-destructive page transforms and deskew.
- `backend/security.py`: SQLite accounts/sessions, guest tokens, rate limits.
- `backend/diagnostics.py`: read-only System check.
- `frontend/`: framework-free HTML/CSS/JS, served as static files.

Storage: page originals are immutable PNGs under `data/jobs/<id>/pages/`;
edits are metadata in `job.json`; previews are a disposable cache under
`data/jobs/<id>/cache/`. Accounts live in `data/access.sqlite3`.

## Decisions

### D1 — Docker is the only supported deployment (2026-10)
One supported path keeps the setup and upgrade story simple and testable.
No native/systemd installer. USB access, when needed, is granted to a device
container, never to the web app container.

### D2 — Folio may create and manage CUPS queues (2026-10, not yet built)
Reverses the 0.9.x rule that Folio never administers CUPS. Setting up a USB
printer without knowing CUPS requires creating queues. Plan: an optional,
bundled CUPS (+ Avahi) container owns USB printers; Folio manages queues
through CUPS's own administrative interface with a dedicated admin
credential, trying driverless (IPP Everywhere / IPP-over-USB) first and
legacy drivers as a fallback. The web container still gets no device access.

### D3 — Git is the source of truth (2026-10)
Releases are tagged commits; release archives are built from tags. Runtime
data (`data/`) and secrets (`.env`) are never committed.

### D4 — Keep the stack small
No frontend build step or framework, no external database or message queue.
SQLite plus in-process background work is sufficient for the expected scale
(a household or small office). Heavy features (OCR, deskew/OpenCV) should
become optional at build time rather than separate editions.

### D5 — Previews are disposable, originals are sacred
Previews render from a cached reduced copy; exports and printing always use
the original pixels. Any cache can be deleted without data loss.

### D6 — Capabilities come from the device, never from model names
Sizes, trays, duplex, colour, scan modes and resolutions are what CUPS/SANE
report. Folio does not fabricate options, and no device, address or network
is hardcoded (enforced by a test).

## Direction

Planned in this order; each step is a separate, tested release. Priorities
may change with real use.

1. **0.10 — Background jobs.** OCR, export and print preparation run as
   tracked tasks with progress, instead of inside an HTTP request (OCR can
   take longer than reverse-proxy timeouts). Split `app.py` into route modules.
2. **0.11 — Appliance.** Optional CUPS + Avahi container in Compose (D2),
   USB printer onboarding, queue creation, AirPrint/IPP Everywhere sharing,
   first-run setup wizard.
3. **0.12 — Scanning for every device.** USB scanner onboarding; sharing
   scanners on the network (eSCL/saned); Lite/Full build options;
   arm64 images.

Before 1.0: a fresh Raspberry Pi plus a supported USB printer reaches a first
print in under 10 minutes; upgrades preserve data; a compatibility list
exists; the container runs as a non-root user.
